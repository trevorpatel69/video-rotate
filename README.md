# Video Rotate

*A phone clip that plays on its side.*

## What Video Rotate is

**Video Rotate** is a media utility. Rotate a video 90 or 180 degrees and write a new file.

A vertical clip imported wrong. You do not want a full NLE.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## Editions

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Features

- 90, 180, 270
- Keeps the source
- mp4 out
- Optional stream metadata

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
